# Temperate_Rianforest_Project
Assessing the impacts of climate change on temperate rainforests using UKCP18 data

  Research Aim:
  
Assess how the bioclimatic conditions that are used to determine temperate rainforests change under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5) 

  Objectives:
  
What does climate change look like the UK's rainforests
provide a picture of UK rainforest areas most vulnerable to climate change.
A consideration of potential rainforest loss due to climate change

Temperate rainforest is a globally rare habitat. The UK holds approximately 7.5% of the temperate rainforest biome and is consequently important to the conservation of the habitat. Sadly, due to deforestation, the UKâ€™s rainforest is fragmented and at risk of biodiversity loss. Fragments of remaining woodland are often at risk from over grazing and suffer from invasive Rhododendron. While these threats of fragmentation, over grazing and invasives are well documented for temperate rainforests, little is understood of the threat that climate change poses to these already fragile woodlands.     

# Temperate Rainforest definitions
Definitons of temperate rainforest across the world and in the UK have often been created by mapping climatic variables. This can be done in a number of different methods, those investigated in this project are listed below;

  The Alaback method
  
In this definition, temperate rainforest is determined by a set of criteria. Anywhere with >1400mm of rainfall, of which at least 10% is in Summer, and with an average July temperature of <16C.

   Oceanicity
   
This definition promotes the idea that climatic variables are being driven primarily by the influence of nearby oceans, resulting in precipitation and stable temperatures. This is determined by combing climate variables into a formula, see formulas used in this project below . 

   Oceanicity = Annual Precipitation / Temperature Range
   
   Index of Hygrothermy = Annual Precipitation * Annual Temperature / Temperature      Range

   Number of rainfall days
   
Temperate rainforests require consistent wet environments. It has been stated that temperate rainforests require >180, and ideally >200 days of rains for hyper oceanic species.

   Vapour Pressure Deficit
   
While not having been directly used to determine rainforest, it is recognised as important for species of lichens and bryophytes that flourish in temperate rainforest.


This project uses RCP8.5 UKCP18 data to see how the climatic variables listed above change between the baseline period 1981 - 2000 and the future of 2061 - 2080.

# Notes on code

Some netCDF files could not be uplaoded due to their size. but the rasters have already been created from these netCDFs so ignore script 1e.
